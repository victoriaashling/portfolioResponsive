                    or some knitting in my hands. I like to dream and to make things, and that's what 
                    excites me most about coding &mdash; there's a promise, and it's a heady 
                    one, that any process you can dream can be created in code. And though there 
                    are plenty of things that must be created in the physical world, there are 
                    plenty more than really can just be pulled from thin air by someone with 
                    an idea and the logic to turn it into reality.-->
